# VitalVista
Vitalvista is a specialized tool designed for biology researchers to process and visualize biological images with depth and heat mapping overlays. The tool is optimized for skeletal imaging and fluorescence overlays, providing clear and detailed insights into biological data. It is particularly useful in applications such as histology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular biology.

[Features]

    Depth Mapping: Visualizes depth information in biological images.
    Heat Mapping: Applies heat maps to highlight areas of interest.
    Skeletal Imaging: Optimized for bone structure visualization.
    Fluorescence Overlays: Handles fluorescence markers with predefined color mappings.
    Customization: Flexible to allow for adjustments in thresholding, color mapping, and image formats.

[Installation]

To install and run Vitalvista, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vitalvista.git
cd vitalvista
pip install -r requirements.txt

[Usage]

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use Vitalvista:

python

from vitalvista import process_image_pair

bf_image_path = 'path/to/bf_image.tif'
uw_image_path = 'path/to/uw_image.tif'
col10_image_path = 'path/to/col10_image.tif'
twist_image_path = 'path/to/twist_image.tif'
output_dir = 'path/to/output/'

process_image_pair(bf_image_path, uw_image_path, col10_image_path, twist_image_path, output_dir)

[Command-Line Usage]

You can also run Vitalvista from the command line:

bash

python vitalvista.py --input_dir /path/to/input/ --output_dir /path/to/output/

[Customization]

Vitalvista is designed with flexibility in mind. You may need to customize it for broader use:

    Thresholding: Adjust the adaptive thresholding parameters to fit different tissue types or imaging conditions.
    Color Mapping: Modify the predefined color mappings for different fluorescence markers.
    Image Format Compatibility: Extend support to handle various image formats beyond .tif.

[Future Enhancements]

Future updates will focus on enhancing the tool's flexibility and performance, including:

    Broader image format support
    Improved performance for large datasets
    Enhanced user interface for easier customization

[Limitations]

    Current Focus: Optimized primarily for skeletal and fluorescence imaging.
    Customization Required: May need adjustments for broader biological applications.
